## MODULE FOUR - CREATING VISUALIZATIONS AND DASHBOARDS FROM THE DATA

**Step 1: Generate export files for Amazon Quicksight**

a)  First run an Athena query to create a database to hold our Forecast tables.  Copy the SQL statement below and run it.

```
create database forecast_db;

```

Once the query completes successfully, look at the **Data Pane** on the left side of the screen.  You will see a **Database** window. Select **samples_db** from the dropdown list of databases.

b) Once again, using Athena, execute the following SQL statement to generate a **RAW** data export table.  This will only be used for reporting against actual data sets.  The query joins raw meter data with grid and meter metadata tables to create a single, fully-attributed raw data export file.  

```
create table london_meter_table 
    WITH (
          external_location = 's3://energy-forecasts/workshop_data/london_meter_data')
as SELECT regexp_extract("$path", '[ \w-]+?(?=\.)') as "block_id", lclid as "item_id", energy_sum as "target_value", date_add('year', 6, DATE(day)) as "timestamp" FROM "AwsDataCatalog"."sample_database"."raw_meter_table"

```

c) Next, execute the following Athena SQL statement to generate a fully-attributed **FORECAST** table by joining the forecast data generated by Amazon Forecast with grid and meter metadata tables.
